# Offline Mode

crisisIQ's offline capabilities allow you to continue learning even when internet connectivity is limited or unavailable.

## How Offline Mode Works

crisisIQ uses Progressive Web App (PWA) technology to cache content locally on your device.

## Enabling Offline Mode

### Automatic Setup

When you install crisisIQ as a PWA:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install PWA">
    Follow installation guide for your device
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Online First">
    Navigate through the app while connected
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Caches Automatically">
    Pages and resources save as you use them
  </Step>

  <Step title="Offline Access Enabled">
    Cached content available offline
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Cache Management

Ensure important content is cached:

**Before Going Offline:**
1. **Open Key Pages**: Visit dashboard, training history, scenarios
2. **Load Documents**: Open resources you might need
3. **Download Certificates**: Save any certificates
4. **Review Scenarios**: Open scenarios you're working on

This ensures they're cached for offline access.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Queued Actions Upload">
    Offline changes send to server
  </Step>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Complete">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Sync

Force synchronization:

1. Pull down to refresh on dashboard
2. Or: Settings > Sync Now
3. Wait for completion
4. Verify data is current

## Storage Management

### How Much Storage Used?

Check storage usage:

- **Android**: Settings > Apps > crisisIQ > Storage
- **iOS**: Settings > General > iPhone Storage > crisisIQ
- **In-App**: Profile > Settings > Storage

**Typical Usage:**
- Base app: 10-20MB
- Cached content: 30-80MB
- Offline scenarios: 5-10MB each
- Media/documents: Varies by content

### Clearing Cache

Free up space if needed:

<Warning>
Clearing cache removes offline content. You'll need to re-cache it by using the app online.
</Warning>

**Steps:**
1. Profile > Settings > Storage
2. Tap "Clear Cache"
3. Confirm action
4. Next online use will re-cache

## Offline Scenario Behavior

### Solo Scenarios

**Starting Offline:**
- Can't start new scenarios
- Can resume if already loaded

**During Offline:**
- View events and information
- Read resources
- Cannot submit decisions
- Progress not saved until online

**Reconnecting:**
- Resume where you left off
- Submit queued decisions
- Sync progress

### Group Simulations

<Note>
Group simulations require active connection for real-time collaboration. Offline use is very limited.
</Note>

**Offline Limitations:**
- Cannot join or participate actively
- Can view briefing if cached
- Chat unavailable
- Events don't update
- Decisions cannot be submitted

## Troubleshooting Offline Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content not available offline">
    **Cause:** Not cached before going offline

    **Solution:**
    - Reconnect and open the content
    - It will cache for next offline use
    - Ensure sufficient storage available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes not syncing">
    **Causes:**
    - Still offline
    - Connection too slow
    - Storage full

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify you're online (check indicator)
    - Wait for stable connection
    - Free up storage space
    - Force sync via refresh
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Offline mode not activating">
    **Causes:**
    - Not installed as PWA
    - Browser not supported
    - Feature disabled

    **Solutions:**
    - Install as PWA (see installation guides)
    - Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari
    - Check settings for offline mode toggle
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App doesn't recognize I'm back online">
    **Solutions:**
    - Close and reopen app
    - Pull down to refresh
    - Toggle airplane mode off/on
    - Restart device
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Safety

### Offline Data Security

- **Local Storage**: Encrypted on device
- **No Unsaved Changes Lost**: Queued for sync
- **Authentication Timeout**: May need to re-login after extended offline period
- **Automatic Logout**: After configured timeout (e.g., 7 days offline)

### Privacy Considerations

- Offline data stored only on your device
- Clearing app data removes all cached content
- Uninstalling app deletes local cache
- Server data remains intact
