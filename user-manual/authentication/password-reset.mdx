## Password Best Practices

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make It Unique">
    Never reuse passwords across different services
  </Step>

  <Step title="Length Over Complexity">
    Longer passwords (12+ characters) are more secure than shorter complex ones
  </Step>

  <Step title="Avoid Patterns">
    Don't use keyboard patterns (qwerty, 12345) or common substitutions (p@ssw0rd)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Passphrases">
    Consider memorable phrases with random words: `Coffee-Train-Mountain-42!`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Password Maintenance

<Check>Change password if you suspect it's compromised</Check>
<Check>Update password periodically (every 90 days recommended)</Check>
<Check>Never share your password with anyone</Check>
<Check>Don't write passwords down in plain text</Check>

## Two-Factor Authentication

For enhanced security, enable 2FA after resetting your password:

<Card title="Enable 2FA" icon="shield-halved" href="/user-manual/settings/profile">
