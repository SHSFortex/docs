# Making Decisions

Decision points are the heart of crisis simulations, where you apply crisis management principles to realistic scenarios.

## Understanding Decision Points

### What Makes a Good Decision?

In crisis simulations, decisions are evaluated on:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Effectiveness" icon="bullseye">
    Does it address the problem?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stakeholder Impact" icon="people-group">
    How does it affect all parties?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Risk Management" icon="shield">
    Balance of risk vs reward
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Efficiency" icon="coins">
    Appropriate use of assets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeliness" icon="clock">
    Made quickly enough?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communication" icon="megaphone">
    Proper stakeholder notification
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Decision-Making Framework

### OODA Loop

Observe → Orient → Decide → Act

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observe">
    Gather information about the current situation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Orient">
    Analyze what the information means in context
  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide">
    Choose the best course of action
  </Step>

  <Step title="Act">
    Commit to your decision and see the outcome
  </Step>
</Steps>

### DECIDE Model

A comprehensive crisis decision framework:

- **D**efine the problem
- **E**stablish criteria for solutions
- **C**onsider alternatives
- **I**dentify the best alternative
- **D**evelop and implement action plan
- **E**valuate and monitor results

## Decision Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Strategic">
    **High-Level Direction**

    - Overall crisis response strategy
    - Resource allocation priorities
    - Long-term vs short-term trade-offs
    - Organizational positioning

    **Example**: Evacuate facility or shelter in place?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Tactical">
    **Implementation Details**

    - How to execute strategy
    - Specific action sequences
    - Team assignments
    - Immediate responses

    **Example**: Which teams evacuate first?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Communication">
    **Stakeholder Management**

    - What to communicate
    - When to communicate
    - Who to inform
    - Message tone and content

    **Example**: Issue public statement now or wait for more information?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Resource">
    **Asset Deployment**

    - Budget allocation
    - Personnel assignment
    - Equipment deployment
    - External support requests

    **Example**: Call in external emergency services?
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Decision Scenarios

### Time-Pressured Decisions

**Challenge**: Must decide quickly with incomplete information

**Strategy**:
<Check>Use 80/20 rule - good enough beats perfect too late</Check>
<Check>Apply standard protocols when available</Check>
<Check>Trust training and instinct</Check>
<Check>Accept that some uncertainty is unavoidable</Check>

### Information-Poor Decisions

**Challenge**: Critical information is missing

**Strategy**:
<Check>Identify what you know vs what you don't</Check>
<Check>Make reasonable assumptions, state them clearly</Check>
<Check>Choose option robust to multiple scenarios</Check>
<Check>Plan to adjust as more info emerges</Check>

### High-Stakes Decisions

**Challenge**: Significant consequences either way

**Strategy**:
<Check>Systematically evaluate each option</Check>
<Check>Consider worst-case scenarios</Check>
<Check>Consult available resources/procedures</Check>
<Check>Balance risk aversion with decisive action</Check>

### Ethical Dilemmas

**Challenge**: Options involve competing values

**Strategy**:
<Check>Identify the ethical principles in conflict</Check>
<Check>Consider stakeholder perspectives</Check>
<Check>Apply organizational values</Check>
<Check>Document reasoning for transparency</Check>

## Decision-Making Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read All Options Before Choosing">
    Don't select the first reasonable option. Review all choices to ensure you're picking the best, not just an acceptable one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Second and Third-Order Effects">
    Think beyond immediate outcomes. What happens next? And after that?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identify Stakeholders">
    Who's affected? Employees, customers, regulators, public, shareholders?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Available Resources">
    Check if emergency plans, procedures, or data can inform your decision.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance Speed and Quality">
    Some decisions need immediate action; others benefit from deliberation. Know which is which.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Reasoning">
    Note why you chose as you did. Helps with learning and real-world accountability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit Fully">
    Once decided, implement decisively. Hesitant execution undermines good decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Team Decision-Making

### Collaborative Decisions

In group simulations, some decisions require team input:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share Information">
    Each team member contributes relevant knowledge
  </Step>

  <Step title="Discuss Options">
    Debate pros/cons of choices
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Consensus">
    Try to align on best option
  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide">
    Vote, reach consensus, or leader decides based on input
  </Step>

  <Step title="Support Decision">
    Once made, team supports it even if it wasn't their preference
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Avoiding Groupthink

<Warning>
**Groupthink Risks:**
- Pressure to conform
- Dismissing alternative views
- Illusion of unanimity
- Self-censorship
</Warning>

**Countermeasures**:
<Check>Encourage devil's advocate role</Check>
<Check>Seek diverse perspectives</Check>
<Check>Question assumptions</Check>
<Check>Consider external viewpoints</Check>

## Learning from Decisions

### After Each Decision

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read Feedback">
    **Understand the Outcome**

    - What happened because of your choice?
    - Why did it score as it did?
    - What were the consequences?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Compare to Alternatives">
    **What If?**

    - What would other options have done?
    - Was your choice optimal?
    - What information would have changed your mind?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Extract the Principle">
    **The Lesson**

    - What crisis management concept is illustrated?
    - What general principle applies?
    - How will this inform future decisions?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apply Going Forward">
    **Immediate Application**

    - How does this affect next decisions?
    - What pattern should you watch for?
    - What will you do differently?
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Decision Pitfalls to Avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Analysis Paralysis" icon="hourglass">
    **Pitfall**: Overthinking to the point of inaction

    **Solution**: Set decision deadlines, use "good enough" standard
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confirmation Bias" icon="eye-slash">
    **Pitfall**: Only seeing information that supports your preferred option

    **Solution**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recency Bias" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Pitfall**: Overweighting the most recent information

    **Solution**: Review all available information, not just latest
  </Card>
  <Card title="Anchoring" icon="anchor">
    **Pitfall**: Fixating on initial information

    **Solution**: Reassess as new data emerges
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sunk Cost Fallacy" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    **Pitfall**: Continuing bad approach because of past investment

    **Solution**: Evaluate based on future, not past
  </Card>
  <Card title="Overconfidence" icon="face-smile">
    **Pitfall**: Too certain despite limited information

    **Solution**: Acknowledge uncertainty, plan contingencies
