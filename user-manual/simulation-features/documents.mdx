- All-clear: Building manager authority only

Application:
- Use this for evacuation decision
- Contact floor wardens for status
- Ensure accountability process
```

### Creating Quick Reference

**Personal Cheat Sheet:**

As you find useful info, jot down:
- Key contacts with roles
- Critical thresholds (e.g., "Evacuate if >100 ppm CO")
- Decision criteria
- Procedures in brief

## Common Resource Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't Find Relevant Document">
    - Try different search terms
    - Browse by category
    - Check if referenced in timeline events
    - Ask AI mentor what type of resource might help
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Too Long">
    - Use search within document
    - Check table of contents
    - Read summary/executive summary first
    - Scan headings for relevant sections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Information Contradicts">

    - Note discrepancy in your decision rationale
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Expected Info">
    - Real crises often have information gaps
    - Make reasonable assumptions
    - Note what you don't know

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Resource-Based Learning

### What Documents Teach

Different resource types develop different skills:

**Procedures** → Process Following, Compliance

**Contact Lists** → Stakeholder Mapping, Escalation

**Data/Reports** → Data-Driven Decision-Making, Analysis

**Policies** → Risk Management, Governance

**Maps** → Spatial Reasoning, Geographic Context

### Connecting Resources to Decisions

Strong decision-making often involves:

1. **Identify Decision**: What needs to be decided?
2. **Find Resource**: Which document might help?
3. **Extract Info**: What does it say?
4. **Apply**: How does this inform the decision?
5. **Cite**: Note that you used this resource

**Example:**
```
Decision: Should we evacuate?

Resource: Emergency Evacuation Plan, Section 4

Info: "Evacuate if fire department advises, or if smoke/flames visible on multiple floors"

Application: Smoke confirmed on 2 floors per event feed → Meets evacuation criteria

Decision: Evacuate now (supported by company procedure)
```
