**Solutions**:

- Alert facilitator if technical issue

## Monitoring Communication Effectiveness

### Self-Assessment Questions

During simulation:
- Is everyone participating in chat?
- Are messages clear and actionable?
- Is critical information being shared?
- Are we coordinating effectively?
- Is anyone being left out of communication loop?

After simulation:
- Review chat logs for patterns
- Identify communication gaps
- Note what worked well
- Plan improvements for next time
