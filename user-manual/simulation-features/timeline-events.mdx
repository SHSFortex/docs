# Timeline Events

Timeline events are the dynamic elements that make simulations realistic - breaking news, incoming messages, and situation updates that unfold over time.

## What Are Timeline Events?

Events are scripted occurrences that:

  <Card title="Provide Information" icon="newspaper">
    News updates, reports, data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Pressure" icon="bolt">
    Escalations, complications, deadlines
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Event Types

### News Updates

Breaking news and media reports:

**Characteristics:**
- External perspective
- Public information

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Emails">

    - May include attachments
    - Require responses
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Phone Calls">

    - Personal connection
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Social Media">

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Status Updates

Changes in the situation:

**Types:**
- **Escalations**: Situation worsens
- **Improvements**: Positive developments
- **New Information**: Previously unknown facts revealed
- **Resource Changes**: Assets become available/unavailable

**Example:**
"UPDATE: Fire department reports flames spreading to 4th floor. Estimated time to contain: 45 minutes."

### Media Clips

## Reading Events Effectively

### Information Extraction

For each event:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Type">
    News, message, status update, or media?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Source">
    Who is providing this information?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Key Facts">
    What are the critical details?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess Credibility">
    How reliable is this source?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Determine Implications">
    How does this affect the situation?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Actions Needed">
    What should you do in response?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Critical vs. Non-Critical

Not all events are equally important:

**Critical Events:**
<Check>Safety threats</Check>
<Check>Regulatory requirements</Check>
<Check>Irreversible consequences</Check>
<Check>High-impact stakeholders</Check>
<Check>Time-sensitive matters</Check>

**Informational Events:**
- Background context
- Minor developments
- Confirmations of known info
- Peripheral stakeholder concerns

**Tip:** Focus attention where it matters most. Don't get distracted by noise.

## Responding to Events

### When Events Require Action

Some events explicitly request a response:

"Email from CEO: Need your recommendation on whether to close all facilities by EOD."

**Response Required:**
1. Acknowledge receipt (if real-time)
2. Gather needed information
3. Formulate recommendation
4. Communicate decision/recommendation
5. Implement action

### When Events Provide Context

Other events inform without requiring immediate action:

"News: Weather forecast predicts storm will pass in 3 hours."

**Use For:**
- Planning decisions
- Timing actions
- Setting expectations
- Understanding constraints

## Event Timing

### Understanding Triggers

Events appear based on:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Absolute Time">
    **Fixed Schedule**

    - 5 minutes into simulation
    - 15 minutes from start
    - 30 minutes elapsed

    Predictable, allows planning
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Relative Time">
    **After Another Event**

    - 10 minutes after initial alarm
    - 5 minutes after first decision
    - Following previous event

    Maintains logical sequence
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Decision-Triggered">
    **Based on Your Choices**

    - If you chose A, event X fires
    - If you chose B, event Y fires
    - Branching scenarios

    Reflects consequences of decisions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conditional">
    **Based on Conditions**

    - If score below threshold
    - If no decision made within time
    - If specific combination of choices

    Adaptive difficulty
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pacing

Event frequency varies by simulation phase:

- **Opening**: Slower, establish situation
- **Escalation**: Faster, create pressure
- **Peak**: Rapid-fire, high intensity
- **Resolution**: Slowing, winding down

## Managing Information Overload

### When Events Come Fast

**Strategies:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Triage">
    Quickly categorize: Urgent, Important, Informational. Address urgent first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delegate (In Teams)">
    Assign team members to monitor different event types or stakeholders.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Take Notes">
    Jot down key points from events so you can reference later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Timeline View">
    Scroll back to review events you missed or want to revisit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on Decisions">
    Some events are atmosphere; others drive decisions. Know which is which.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Staying Organized

**Create Structure:**

**Physical Notes:**
```
CRITICAL INFO:
- Casualties: 3 confirmed
- Resources: Fire dept ETA 10min
- Stakeholders: Employees evacuated, customers notified

TO DO:
- Decide on facility closure
- Draft public statement
- Contact insurance

QUESTIONS:
- Structural damage extent?
- When can operations resume?
```

## Event-Driven Learning

### What Events Teach

Different event types develop different skills:

**News Events** → Media Relations, Reputation Management

**Stakeholder Messages** → Communication, Empathy

**Status Updates** → Situation Assessment, Adaptation

**Resource Changes** → Flexibility, Contingency Planning

### Connecting Events to Decisions

After a decision, watch for:

- Events showing consequences
- Stakeholder reactions
- Situation evolution
- New information that validates/contradicts your choice

This feedback loop is where learning happens.
