## Skill-Specific Metrics

### Decision-Making

- **Optimal Decision Rate**: % of best choices made
- **Partial Credit**: Acceptable but suboptimal choices
- **Poor Decisions**: Choices to avoid
- **Decision Patterns**: Risk tolerance, speed vs quality

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Identification**: Spotting threats
- **Risk Evaluation**: Assessing severity
- **Risk Mitigation**: Choosing appropriate responses
- **Contingency Planning**: Preparing for scenarios

### Communication

- **Stakeholder Consideration**: Including affected parties
- **Timeliness**: Communicating at right time
- **Clarity**: Clear, actionable messaging
- **Channel Selection**: Appropriate communication methods

### Resource Management

- **Information Gathering**: Using available documents
- **Efficiency**: Optimal resource allocation
- **Prioritization**: Focus on critical resources
- **Innovation**: Creative resource use

## Analytics Dashboard

### Personal Analytics

Track your progress:

**Over Time:**
- Score trends (improving, stable, declining?)
- Skill development trajectories
- Category strengths/weaknesses
- Consistency metrics

**Across Scenarios:**
- Performance by difficulty level
- Performance by crisis type
- Solo vs group comparison
- Best/worst scenarios

### Comparative Analytics

(Where available):

**Benchmarking:**
- Vs organization average
- Vs peer group
- Vs industry standards
- Top performer comparisons

**Ranking:**
- Leaderboards (if opt-in)
- Percentile ranking
- Category-specific ranking

## Decision Patterns

### Decision-Making Style

Analysis of your tendencies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Risk Profile">
    **Risk Tolerance**

    - Conservative (safety-first)
    - Balanced (measured approach)
    - Aggressive (bold action)

    No single best style - depends on situation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Decision Speed">
    **Deliberation vs Action**

    - Quick decider (fast but risk errors)
    - Deliberate (thorough but slower)
    - Balanced (situational)

    Optimal varies by crisis phase
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Information Use">
    **Research vs Intuition**

    - Data-driven (heavy document use)
    - Balanced (selective research)
    - Intuition-led (experience-based)

    Best performers adapt approach
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pattern Insights

Look for:

- **Strengths**: Consistent good performance in certain areas
- **Weaknesses**: Recurring struggles
- **Blind Spots**: Regularly missed information
- **Tendencies**: Default approaches (good or limiting)

## Advanced Metrics

### Time-Based Analysis

**Response Time Breakdown:**

- **Fast decisions** (< 30 seconds): Rushed or confident?
- **Moderate** (30s - 2min): Balanced consideration
- **Slow** (> 2min): Thorough or indecisive?

**Correlation:**
- Speed vs accuracy
- Optimal decision time by decision type
- Impact of time pressure on quality

### Resource Correlation

**Document Impact:**

- Which documents correlate with good decisions?
- Unused resources that would have helped
- Over-reliance on certain resource types
- Research efficiency

### Skill Interdependencies

Some skills support others:

- **Communication** + **Stakeholder Mgmt** = Stronger together
- **Risk Assessment** enables better **Decision-Making**
- **Resource Mgmt** supports **Information Gathering**

## Using Metrics for Improvement

### Gap Analysis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Lowest Scores">
    Which skills rate lowest?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand Why">
    Review feedback for those skill areas
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Patterns">
    Do poor scores cluster in certain scenario types?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prioritize">
    Which gaps are most critical to address?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Target Practice">
    Choose scenarios that exercise weak skills
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Goal Setting

**SMART Goals:**

- **Specific**: "Improve stakeholder communication from 65% to 80%"
- **Measurable**: Track score in that skill area
- **Achievable**: Realistic given time and resources
- **Relevant**: Matters for your role/goals
- **Time-Bound**: "Within 3 months / 10 scenarios"

### Progress Tracking

Monitor improvement:

- **Weekly/Monthly reviews**: Regular check-ins
- **Trend charts**: Visual progress
- **Milestone celebrations**: Recognize achievements
- **Adjust strategies**: If not improving, change approach

## Organizational Metrics

### For Administrators

Company-wide analytics:

**Aggregate Performance:**
- Average scores by department
- Completion rates
- Time to competency
- Training ROI

**Skill Gaps:**
- Organization-wide weaknesses
- Department-specific needs
- Role-based proficiencies

**Training Effectiveness:**
- Scenario difficulty calibration
- Learning curve analysis
- Retention over time
