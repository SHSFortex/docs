# Timeline Builder

The Timeline Builder allows you to create sequences of events that unfold during a simulation, making scenarios dynamic and realistic.

## What is a Timeline?

A timeline is the sequence of events that occur during a simulation:

- **News Updates**: Breaking news, reports, announcements
- **Incoming Messages**: Emails, calls, texts from stakeholders
- **Status Changes**: Situation escalations or improvements
- **Media Releases**: Press coverage, social media activity
- **Resource Updates**: New information becomes available

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Format" icon="newspaper">
    - Headline
    - News body
    - Source (news organization)
    - Image/video
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Message/Email

Communications from stakeholders:

- **From**: Sender name and role
- **To**: Recipient (participant or role)
- **Subject**: Email subject line
- **Body**: Message content
- **Attachments**: Documents, images
- **Urgency**: Normal, Important, Urgent

### Phone Call

Simulated incoming calls:

- **Caller**: Name and organization
- **Purpose**: Why they're calling
- **Audio**: Optional audio message
- **Transcript**: Written version
- **Action Required**: Must respond? Call back?

### Status Change

Updates to the crisis situation:

- **Element**: What changed (casualties, damage, resources)
- **New Status**: Updated information
- **Impact**: How this affects the situation
- **Visual**: Dashboard widget update, map change

### Media Clip

Video or audio content:

- **Type**: News broadcast, social media video, interview
- **Duration**: Length of clip
- **File**: Upload video/audio
- **Transcript**: For accessibility
- **Context**: When/where this is from

### Document Release

New information becomes available:

- **Document Name**: Report, plan, data, etc.
- **File**: PDF, image, spreadsheet
- **Source**: Who released it
- **Summary**: Quick overview

## Event Timing

### Absolute Timing

Fixed time from simulation start:

```
Event triggers at: 5 minutes
Event triggers at: 15 minutes
Event triggers at: 30 minutes
```

Best for:
- Structured scenarios
- Predictable progressions
- Timed phases

### Relative Timing

Based on another event:

```
5 minutes after "Initial Briefing"
10 minutes after "First Decision"
```

Best for:
- Dependent events
- Logical sequences
- Reaction scenarios

### Conditional Timing

Triggered by participant actions:

```
If Decision A → Option 1: Trigger "Positive Outcome Event"
If Decision A → Option 2: Trigger "Negative Outcome Event"
If no decision within 10 min: Trigger "Escalation Event"
```

Best for:
- Branching scenarios
- Consequence-based learning
- Adaptive difficulty

## Event Dependencies

### Creating Event Chains

Link events together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Parent Event">
    Click the event that should trigger others
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dependent Event">
    Click **Add Dependent Event** or draw connection
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Condition">
    - Always follow parent
    - Only if decision X
    - Only if time threshold met
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Timing">
    How long after parent event should child trigger?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Branching Scenarios

Create different paths:

```
Decision Point: "Do you evacuate?"
├─ Yes → Event: "Evacuation underway" → Event: "Traffic issues"
└─ No → Event: "Staying in place" → Event: "Conditions worsen"
```

<Note>
Complex branching increases scenario difficulty and testing needs. Start simple, add complexity gradually.
</Note>

## Event Content Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Realistic Content">
    Write events as they would actually appear:
    - Authentic news language
    - Realistic email formats
    - Appropriate urgency and tone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gradual Escalation">
    Build tension over time:
    - Start with manageable situation
    - Introduce complications gradually
    - Peak at crisis midpoint
    - Resolution opportunities near end
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Varied Sources">
    Mix event types and sources:
    - News media
    - Internal communications
    - External stakeholders
    - Social media
    - Official channels
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Information Density">
    Balance detail with clarity:
    - Enough info to make decisions
    - Not so much it's overwhelming
    - Key details highlighted
    - Supporting docs available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pacing">
    Time events appropriately:
    - Don't flood participants
    - Allow thinking time between events
    - Increase pace during climax
    - Slow down for resolution
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multimedia in Events

### Adding Images

3. Add caption
4. Set display: Inline, attachment, or popup

**Good Uses:**
- Damage photos
- Maps with highlighted areas
- Charts and graphs
- Social media screenshots

### Adding Videos

1. Upload video file (MP4 recommended)
2. Or embed from YouTube/Vimeo
3. Add title and description
4. Transcript for accessibility

**Good Uses:**
- News broadcasts
- Eyewitness videos
- Stakeholder statements
- Instructional clips

### Audio Files

- Ambient sounds

## Testing Your Timeline

### Preview Mode

Test the timeline before publishing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Preview Timeline'">
    Button in timeline editor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Speed">
    - Real-time (as participants will experience)
    - Fast-forward (2x, 5x, 10x speed)
    - Step-by-step (manually advance)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Through">
    Watch events trigger in sequence
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Decisions">
    Make different choices to see branching
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Timing">
    Verify pacing feels right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Issues">
    Document what needs adjustment
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Issues to Check

<Check>Events in logical order</Check>
<Check>No timing conflicts (multiple events at once)</Check>
<Check>All branches reachable</Check>
<Check>Media files load correctly</Check>
<Check>Text readable and error-free</Check>
<Check>Appropriate pacing (not too fast/slow)</Check>

## Advanced Features

### Random Events

Add unpredictability:

1. Create **Random Event Pool**
2. Add multiple possible events
3. Set probability for each
4. System randomly selects which fires

**Example:**
```
At 20 minutes, trigger ONE of:
- 40% chance: Minor complication
- 30% chance: Moderate complication
- 20% chance: Major complication
- 10% chance: Unexpected help
```

### Participant-Triggered Events

Events that fire based on participant actions:

- **Performance-Based**: Trigger if score above/below threshold
- **Speed-Based**: If decisions made quickly/slowly
- **Inactivity**: If no action for X minutes
- **Collaboration**: If team communicates/doesn't communicate

### Dynamic Content

Content that adapts:

- **Personalization**: Use participant's name, role, company
- **Variables**: Reference previous decisions
- **Calculations**: Show updated statistics based on choices

**Example:**
```
"Based on your decision to [DECISION], casualties are now [CALCULATED_CASUALTIES]."
```

## Timeline Templates

### Using Templates

Save time with pre-built timelines:

1. **Browse Templates**: Standard crisis types (fire, cyber, natural disaster)
2. **Select Template**: Choose closest match
3. **Apply to Scenario**: Timeline populates
4. **Customize**: Modify events to fit your needs

### Creating Templates

Save your timeline for reuse:

1. Build timeline
2. Click **Save as Template**
3. Name template
4. Set visibility (personal or organization)
5. Template available for future scenarios

## Collaborative Timeline Editing

### Working with Co-Creators

- **Real-Time Sync**: See others' changes live
- **Event Locking**: Event locked while being edited
- **Comments**: Add notes on events for collaborators
- **Version Control**: Revert if needed
