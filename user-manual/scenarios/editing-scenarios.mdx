# Editing Scenarios

Learn how to update, refine, and improve your crisis simulation scenarios.

## Opening a Scenario for Editing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Scenarios">
    Click **Scenarios** in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Scenario">
    Use search or filters to locate the scenario
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Scenario">
    Click on the scenario title or row
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Edit'">
    Button in top-right corner (if you have permission)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Modify content in the editor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** or **Save & Publish**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who Can Edit

You can edit a scenario if:

<Check>You created it</Check>
<Check>You're added as a collaborator with edit permissions</Check>
<Check>You're a Company Admin</Check>
<Check>The scenario is unpublished/draft (organization settings dependent)</Check>

<Note>
If you see "View Only" mode, you don't have edit permissions. Contact the scenario creator or your admin.
</Note>

## Editing Published Scenarios

### Impact on Active Simulations

<Warning>
**Important**: Editing a published scenario affects new simulations but NOT currently running ones. Running simulations use a snapshot from when they were started.
</Warning>

When you edit a published scenario:

- **New Simulations**: Use the updated version
- **Active Simulations**: Continue with original version
- **Scheduled Simulations**: Use updated version when they start

### Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Minor Edits">
    **Safe to Update Directly:**

    - Fixing typos
    - Updating resource links
    - Clarifying instructions
    - Improving feedback text
    - Adjusting formatting
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Major Changes">
    **Create New Version:**

    - Adding/removing decisions
    - Changing scoring logic
    - Restructuring timeline
    - Modifying roles
    - Altering learning objectives

    Consider: **Duplicate** → **Edit** → **Publish as v2**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Auto-Save Drafts:**
- Every 30 seconds while editing
- Draft versions kept for 30 days
- Can restore from drafts

**Manual Versions:**
1. Click **Save as Version**
2. Add version note/description
3. Version saved with timestamp

### Version History

View and manage versions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Scenario">
    In view or edit mode
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Version History'">
    Usually in top menu or sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse Versions">
    See list of all saved versions with:
    - Date/time
    - Author
    - Version notes
    - Major/minor version number
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare Versions">
    Select two versions to see differences highlighted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restore (if needed)">
    Click **Restore This Version** to revert
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Version Naming Convention

Suggested naming:
- **v1.0**: Initial published version
- **v1.1**: Minor update (typos, clarifications)
- **v2.0**: Major revision (new content, structure changes)
- **v2.1-beta**: Testing version

## Collaborative Editing

### Adding Collaborators

Share editing access:

1. Open scenario
2. **Settings** > **Collaborators**
3. **+ Add Collaborator**
4. Search user by name/email
5. Set permission level:
   - **View Only**: Can preview but not edit
   - **Can Edit**: Full editing access
   - **Owner**: Transfer ownership (removes you as owner)
6. Save

### Working with Co-Editors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-Time Collaboration">
    If multiple editors are in the scenario:
    - You'll see indicators of who else is editing
    - Changes sync in real-time (or on save, depending on configuration)
    - Avoid editing the same section simultaneously
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Edit Conflicts">
    If two editors save conflicting changes:
    - System alerts to conflict
    - Review both versions
    - Merge manually or choose one
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comments & Feedback">
    Use comments to communicate:
    - Highlight content
    - Click **Add Comment**
    - Other editors can reply
    - Mark as resolved when addressed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Edited Scenarios

After making changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Ensure all edits are saved
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Scenario">
    Click **Preview** to run through as participant
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Changed Elements">
    Focus on:
    - Modified decisions
    - New timeline events
    - Updated resources
    - Altered scoring
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check All Paths">
    If branching scenario, test each path
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Scoring">
    Ensure points calculate correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mobile Preview">
    Test on mobile if participants will use phones/tablets
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Ask a colleague to run through the edited scenario without telling them what you changed. Fresh eyes catch issues.
</Tip>

## Common Edits

### Improving Decision Quality

Make decisions more effective:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add Context">
    Provide more background information so participants can make informed choices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance Options">
    Ensure all options are plausible. Avoid one "obviously correct" answer unless intentional.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clarify Consequences">
    Improve feedback text to explain why choices were good/poor and what might happen as a result.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust Timing">
    Give appropriate time limits. Too short creates stress; too long allows over-analysis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Enhancing Realism

Make scenarios more authentic:

- **Update Statistics**: Use current data and figures
- **Recent Events**: Reference recent crisis examples
- **Authentic Documents**: Use realistic-looking forms, reports, emails
- **Appropriate Language**: Match terminology to industry/organization

### Adjusting Difficulty

Make scenarios easier or harder:

**To Make Easier:**
- Provide more resources
- Clearer decision options
- More time for decisions
- Helpful AI mentor hints
- Lower passing threshold

**To Make Harder:**
- Limited information
- More ambiguous choices
- Shorter time limits
- Complex branching
- Higher passing threshold

## Bulk Editing

### Updating Multiple Scenarios

If you need to make similar changes across scenarios:

1. Identify commonalities (e.g., all use same outdated resource)
2. Edit each scenario individually, OR
3. Use **Bulk Update** feature (if available):
   - Select multiple scenarios
   - Choose **Bulk Edit**
   - Make common changes (tags, category, settings)
   - Apply to all

### Templates

Create reusable elements:

- **Decision Templates**: Save common decision types
- **Event Templates**: Reuse event structures
- **Resource Packs**: Bundle related documents/media

Use templates when editing to maintain consistency.

## Tracking Changes

### Change Log

Document what you changed:

1. After editing, add **Version Note**
2. Describe changes:
   - "Fixed typo in Event 3 description"
   - "Added new decision point at 20 minutes"
   - "Updated scoring weights based on feedback"
3. Tag change type: **Bug Fix**, **Enhancement**, **Content Update**

### Audit Trail

For compliance or review:

- All edits logged automatically
- Who changed what and when
- Accessible via **Audit Log** (Admin view)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    - Confirm changes were saved
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost unsaved work">
    - Check **Drafts** section for auto-saved version

## Best Practices

<Check>**Test after editing**: Always preview before republishing</Check>
<Check>**Document changes**: Use version notes</Check>
<Check>**Incremental updates**: Make small changes, test, then continue</Check>
<Check>**Backup important scenarios**: Duplicate before major edits</Check>
<Check>**Get feedback**: Have others review changed scenarios</Check>
<Check>**Schedule updates**: Don't edit scenarios with scheduled simulations</Check>
