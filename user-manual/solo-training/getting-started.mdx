### Decision-Making Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the Situation">
    Understand what's happening in the crisis right now
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the Question">
    What decision needs to be made?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Options">
    Read all available choices carefully
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider Consequences">
    Think through likely outcomes of each option
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Resources">
    Check if documents provide helpful information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask AI if Stuck">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Choice">

  </Step>

  <Step title="See Feedback">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Decision Example

```
Scenario: Office Fire

Situation: Smoke detected on the 3rd floor. Automatic alarm has sounded.

Decision: Immediate Action Required

Options:
A) Evacuate entire building immediately
B) Send security to investigate first
C) Call fire department, wait for their arrival
D) Evacuate only 3rd floor, monitor situation

[Resources Available: Emergency Evacuation Plan, Building Map]
[AI Mentor: Available for hints]
```

**Good Approach:**
1. Check Emergency Evacuation Plan
2. Consider building occupancy
3. Ask AI: "What factors should I consider for evacuation decisions?"
4. Weigh safety vs disruption
5. Make informed choice
6. Review feedback

### When to Use the Mentor

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="When Stuck" icon="circle-question">
    Can't decide between options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Need Framework" icon="diagram-project">

    Don't understand something
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learning" icon="book-open">
    Want to know why something matters
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How to Ask

**Good Questions:**
- "What factors should I consider for this decision?"
- "Can you explain the pros and cons of option A?"
- "What crisis management framework applies here?"
- "Why might stakeholder communication be important now?"

**Less Helpful Questions:**
- "Which option is correct?" (Mentor won't tell you directly)
- "What should I do?" (Too broad, ask about specific considerations)

### Mentor Interaction Tips

<Check>Ask specific questions rather than general ones</Check>
<Check>Use hints to guide thinking, not replace it</Check>
<Check>Engage with mentor's questions back to you</Check>
<Check>Apply mentor's frameworks to make your own decision</Check>
