# During Solo Simulations

Make the most of your solo training by using all available features and following effective strategies.

## Solo Simulation Flow

A typical solo scenario follows this pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Briefing">
    Context and objectives (2-3 minutes)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Opening Situation">
    Crisis begins, initial information provided
  </Step>

  <Step title="Early Decisions">
    First few decisions to stabilize situation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Escalation">
    Crisis intensifies, more complex decisions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Turning Point">
    Critical decisions that significantly impact outcome
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolution">
    Final decisions leading to crisis conclusion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap-Up">
    See final outcome and immediate feedback
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Effective Decision-Making

## Maximizing AI Mentor Value

### Strategic Mentor Use

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before Deciding">
    **Use mentor to**:

    - Understand unfamiliar concepts
    - Get framework for analysis
    - Identify what information matters
    - Brainstorm considerations
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="After Feedback">
    **Use mentor to**:

    - Understand why choice scored as it did
    - Learn the principle behind the feedback
    - Ask how to apply learning to future decisions
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="When Stuck">
    **Use mentor to**:

    - Get unstuck without giving up
    - Understand trade-offs
    - Think through consequences

### Effective Mentor Questions

**Instead of**: "What should I do?"

**Try**: "What factors are most important in evacuation decisions?"

**Instead of**: "Is option A correct?"

**Try**: "What are the trade-offs between options A and B?"

**Instead of**: "I don't know."

**Try**: "I'm torn between prioritizing safety vs. business continuity. How do I weigh these?"

## Time and Pace Management

### Self-Paced Benefits

Take advantage of solo training flexibility:

<Check>**Pause for Research**: Look up unfamiliar terms or concepts</Check>
<Check>**Reflect Before Deciding**: No time pressure means thoughtful choices</Check>
<Check>**Break When Needed**: Take 5-10 minute breaks if losing focus</Check>
<Check>**Review Past Events**: Scroll back through timeline anytime</Check>

### When to Push Through

Balance flexibility with momentum:

- **Don't overthink**: If you've considered options thoroughly, decide
- **Avoid paralysis**: Good decision now often beats perfect decision eventually
- **Stay engaged**: Long breaks can lose scenario immersion
- **Time yourself optionally**: Self-impose time limits for challenge
