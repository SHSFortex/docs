# Group Simulations Overview

Group simulations allow teams to work together through crisis scenarios, practicing collaboration, communication, and coordinated decision-making.

## What are Group Simulations?

Group simulations are team-based training exercises where:

- Multiple participants work together
- Each person may have a specific role
- Team must collaborate to manage the crisis
- Communication happens in real-time
- Collective decisions affect outcomes

## Simulation Phases

Every group simulation follows a structured workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparation">
    Setup and configuration before the simulation begins
  </Step>

  <Step title="Briefing">
    Participants receive instructions, roles, and context
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execution">
    The active simulation where the crisis unfolds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Debriefing">
    Review, reflection, and feedback
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reports">
    Final analysis and performance metrics
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Roles in Group Simulations

<Check>Creates and configures the simulation</Check>
<Check>Assigns participants to roles</Check>
<Check>Monitors progress</Check>
<Check>Can pause/resume or intervene</Check>
<Check>Leads debriefing</Check>
