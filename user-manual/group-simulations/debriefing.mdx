# Debriefing Phase

The debriefing phase is crucial for turning simulation experiences into lasting learning through reflection, discussion, and feedback.

## Purpose of Debriefing

Debriefing helps participants:

- What crisis management principles did you apply?
- What patterns did you notice?

**How to Apply:**
- What specific actions will you take back to your role?

## Self-Directed Debriefing

### Individual Reflection

Participants answer prompts:

    - How did you handle time pressure?
    - What influenced your choices?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Collaboration">
    **Teamwork**

    - How effectively did the team communicate?
    - Did everyone contribute?
    - Were roles clear and respected?
    - How could collaboration improve?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Learning">
    **Key Insights**

    - What did you learn about crisis management?
    - What did you learn about yourself?
    - What surprised you?
    - What will you remember most?
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Application">
    **Next Steps**

    - One thing you'll do differently in real crisis
    - One skill you'll work on
    - One resource you'll create/update
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Team Discussion

Structured conversation:

1. **Round Robin Sharing**: Each person shares one key insight
2. **Decision Review**: Revisit 2-3 critical decisions as a team
3. **Team Strengths/Gaps**: What worked, what needs improvement
4. **Action Planning**: Specific steps to implement learnings

## Debriefing Tools

### Timeline Review

Visual playback of the simulation:

- See all events in sequence
- Your decisions highlighted
- Consequences shown
- Alternative paths revealed

**Use it to:**
- Identify when things went right/wrong
- Understand cause and effect
- See what you missed
- Explore "what if" scenarios

### Performance Dashboard

Metrics and analytics:

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Don't Skip Debriefing">
    It's tempting to end after execution, but debriefing is where real learning happens. Allocate sufficient time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Honest">
    Acknowledge mistakes and uncertainties. Growth comes from honest self-assessment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on Process, Not Just Outcomes">
    Even if results were good, examine why. Understanding your process helps you repeat success.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Make It Safe">
    No blame or judgment. The goal is learning, not evaluation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connect to Real World">
    Always ask "How does this apply to our actual work?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Insights">
    Write down learnings immediately. They fade quickly otherwise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Actionable Plans">
    Don't just identify lessons—commit to specific actions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Debriefing Pitfalls

<Warning>
**Avoid These Mistakes:**

- **Rushing**: Cutting debriefing short undermines learning
- **Blaming**: Pointing fingers instead of analyzing process
- **Defensiveness**: Justifying every decision instead of reflecting
- **Staying Surface-Level**: Not probing deeply into why decisions were made
- **No Follow-Through**: Not actually implementing action items
- **Facilitator Lecturing**: Too much telling, not enough asking
</Warning>
