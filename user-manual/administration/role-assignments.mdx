</Note>

## Role Promotion Workflow

### Requesting a Role Change

If a user needs elevated permissions:

1. **User Requests**: User contacts Company Admin
2. **Admin Reviews**: Evaluates business need
3. **Approval**: Determines if role change is appropriate
4. **Assignment**: Admin updates user's role
5. **Notification**: User informed of change

### Approving Role Requests

Best practices for admins:

<Check>Verify business need for elevated role</Check>
<Check>Ensure user has necessary training</Check>
<Check>Document reason for role change</Check>
<Check>Set review date for temporary elevations</Check>
<Check>Notify user of new responsibilities</Check>

## Role Constraints

### Subscription Limits

Some plans limit roles:

- **Starter Plan**: Limited admin seats
- **Professional**: More Creator licenses
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited roles

Check your subscription details to see role limits.

### Organization Rules

Admins may set policies:

- Minimum number of Admins (e.g., at least 2)
- Maximum Creators (budget constraints)
- Approval required for Admin promotion
- Automatic role expiry (temporary elevations)

## Monitoring Role Usage

### Role Distribution Report

View how roles are distributed:

1. **Administration** > **Reports** > **Role Distribution**
2. See breakdown by role type
3. Compare to subscription limits
4. Identify unused licenses

### Role Activity Tracking

Monitor what users do with their roles:

- **Admin Actions Log**: Who made what changes
- **Creator Activity**: Scenarios created/edited
- **Participant Engagement**: Simulation completion rates

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Grant users the minimum role necessary to perform their job. Most users should be Participants.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Role Audits">
    Review all user roles quarterly:
    - Are elevated roles still needed?
    - Have users changed positions?
    - Are there any inactive accounts with admin access?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Admin Role Limits">
    Limit Company Admin roles to 2-5 trusted individuals. More admins increase security risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Role Changes">
    Keep a log of when and why roles were changed for compliance and auditing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revoke Access Promptly">
    When employees leave or change roles, update their crisisIQ access immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary Elevations">
    For one-time tasks, consider temporarily elevating a role then downgrading after completion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Role Change Notifications

### Automatic Notifications

Configure whether users are notified when their role changes:

1. **Company Settings** > **Notifications**
2. Toggle **"Notify on Role Change"**
3. Customize email template (optional)

### What Users Receive

When role changes, user gets email with:

- **Old Role** → **New Role**
- **Changed By**: Admin who made the change
- **Date**: When change occurred
- **Next Steps**: Link to documentation for new role

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot assign Admin role">
    - Check subscription limits for Admin seats
    - Verify you have permission to grant Admin (System Admin may be required)
    - Ensure user's email is verified
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role change not reflecting">
    - User needs to log out and back in
    - Clear browser cache and cookies
    - Check if change was actually saved
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User sees features they shouldn't">
    - Verify the user's current role
    - Check if they belong to multiple organizations with different roles
    - Ensure they're viewing the correct company context
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot remove last Admin">
    Organizations must have at least one Company Admin. Promote another user to Admin before downgrading the last one.
